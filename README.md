This project has a few cool features that make it stand out. 

It allows users to: 

- Add Piano and bass instruments as a template
- Edit individual strudel instruments
- Change cycles per minute and global gain using the sliders on the right
- Mute instruments by using the checkbox
- View a d3 graph to visualise the notes being played. 
- Save the instruments to storage so that they can be viewed later.
